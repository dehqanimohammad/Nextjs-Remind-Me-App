Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Node.js (version specified in package.json)<br />
npm (or yarn) package manager<br />
Clone the Repository:<br />

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dehqanimohammad/Nextjs-Remind-Me-app.git

```

Install Dependencies:<br />

```bash
cd Nextjs-Remind-Me-app
npm install  # or yarn install

```

Environment Setup:<br />

Important: Never commit your .env file to version control (e.g., GitHub) as it might contain sensitive API keys or passwords.<br />

Create a file named .env in your project's root directory. This file will not be tracked by Git.<br />
To configure your local development environment, copy the .env.example file to a new file named .env. Then, replace the placeholders in the .<br />env file with your own API keys and other sensitive information.<br />

```bash

npm run dev  # or yarn dev

```

This starts the development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.<br />
