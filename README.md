Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Node.js (version specified in package.json)
npm (or yarn) package manager
Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dehqanimohammad/Nextjs-Remind-Me-app.git

```

Install Dependencies:

```bash
cd Nextjs-Remind-Me-app
npm install  # or yarn install

```

Environment Setup:

Important: Never commit your .env file to version control (e.g., GitHub) as it might contain sensitive API keys or passwords.

Create a file named .env in your project's root directory. This file will not be tracked by Git.
To configure your local development environment, copy the .env.example file to a new file named .env. Then, replace the placeholders in the .env file with your own API keys and other sensitive information.

```bash

npm run dev  # or yarn dev

```

This starts the development server, typically accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Deployment

Choose a Platform:

Vercel (https://vercel.com/) (already deployed to https://nextjs-remind-me-app-navy.vercel.app/).
Netlify (https://www.netlify.com/).
AWS Amplify (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html).
Heroku (https://www.heroku.com/).
Others (follow platform-specific instructions).
Build for Production:

```bash
npm run build  # or yarn build
```

This creates an optimized production-ready build in the .next directory.
